Prologue
In a far away land, in a time long forgotten, there was a young man returning home 
from a battle fought in the name of his king. 
The young soldier was longing for his family, his mother and father, that he had left
a few years before. 
But the land he returned to was not the land he had left. His king had fallen in war
and without an heir to take his place the kingdom now was torn between many minor
lords seeking dominion for themselves. On his long trek back he heard stories of an 
evil lord, close to the family farm, ravaging the land and killing all who opposed him.
As he came closer to home the young soldier got more and more worried for the safety of 
his family. When he finally reached the farm it was night. Rain was falling and he 
could hear thunder rumble in the distance. There was an eerie stillness in the air as 
he approached his home...
