Tavern One
The soldier has some well deserved rest at the tavern. 
After speaking a bit to the barman he finds out that he actually used to work for the 
Lord in the mansion. The Lord had always been considered an evil man but a few years 
ago it had gotten worse. He had started becoming more and more aggressive toward his 
servants. And after a few of the servants had disappeared mysteriously he had seen no 
other option but to flee the mansion. The soldier decides to tell the barman his story 
of what had happened to his family and the barman promises to help him with whatever 
information he can give about the lord and the mansion...
