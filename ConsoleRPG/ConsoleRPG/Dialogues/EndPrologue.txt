End Prologue
Trails of blood were leading away from the farm towards a nearby village. And just 
outside this village lay the mansion belonging to the evil Lord. The young soldier 
had sworn to avenge his family and set out on the path to the village. 
He remembered stories of the Lord that he had heard as a small child. There had been 
rumors of dark and occult rituals taking place at the mansion of the Lord. Some even 
said that the Lord had sold his soul to a demon and in turn had been given powers to 
control terrifying creatures of darkness.
The young soldier shivered at the thought of this but determined to avenge his family
he did not stray from the path before him!
