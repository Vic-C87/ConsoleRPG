Bedroom Key
2
#1*Barman! I'm in need of your assistance.
1*Ah of course traveller! What can I help you with?
#2*I'm having trouble finding my way in the mansion. Most of the doors seems to be locked and I can't seem to find anyway through them.
2*Well from what I remember there should be a spare key for the bedroom door in the cloakroom, just north of the great hall.
#3*Thank you barman! I will search there for it.
